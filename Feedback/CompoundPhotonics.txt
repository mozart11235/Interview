The company doesn't really have oomph in their product on the face of it, how
can you really make a projector cool, maybe you can and maybe they will but in
itself to make a major business might be really hard. The company also has a
bad history of repeated failures. 

What I did well in the interview?

I think I talked well, though I might have talked a little too much.

What I did NOT DO well in the interview?

     Interview with HR Stacey Stovall
         1. I shouldn't have told her about shyness, probably makes me
            look not collaborative, which is so important in a startup.
         2. I shouldn't have criticized Microsoft and my team.

     Tech Interview with Gavin Cheng
         1. This was the worst tech interview I gave with this company.
         2. I did not really do well on solving the problem as well as writing
            the code.
         3. Never say you have understood something if you haven't.
         4. It seems to me I am slow at understanding solutions which seem
            clear to people in their heads.
         5. Coding question was,
            start:hit
            end: dog
            dictionary: hot,got,cot,cog

            Find a way from start to end if there exists one in the
            dictionary, you can only change one letter at a time.
