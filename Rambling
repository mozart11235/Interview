 I want to work at a place where

1. I contribute both in terms of product development as well product design. I want to be part of the Jury that this aspect of the product doesn't look good enough, we need to improvise on it. I want to have the independence of changing significant part of an existing implementation for better performance over a weekend without having to worry about churn.


2. I have over five years of professional software engineering experience. Some of the products in the market which I have worked on are Sony Xperia P,U, Sola phones, HTC sensation, several Android phones with Qualcomm chipsets. At Microsoft I work in the Operating systems group, I have worked on features for both Windows 10 and Redstone. I just finished writing a new DeviceID API for the Redstone release.

I work best when working for for objectives, goals and timelines rather than like in a hobby project environment. I need a job which will push me to the limits of learning and producing on a daily basis. My ideal way of working would be to work very hard for 25 days a month and then take it easy for the remaining 5, repeat rinse.

I want to be working with the latest tools and not be stuck with legacy. The only way I will be relevant in 2030 (when robots will be doing the trivial stuff)
